# CPSC1150-Assignment2
Practicing writing algorithms and pseudocode

This program calculates the wind chill index when given the temperature in Celsius and the wind speed in kilometres by the user. Rudimentary input validation is included - an error message is generated in the console when the user enters invalid data. The algorithm for the program and pseudocode was put in external documentation which I've included in the repo.
